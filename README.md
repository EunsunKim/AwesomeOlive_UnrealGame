# Overview

  - This game follows the classical arcade game style, where a player can run, jump, gain points, fights with enemies, and proceeds to the next level by achieving goals.
  - This level shows the first level of the game, right after the intro cinematic and tutorial level.

# Game Structure

  - Press F key to fire the missile and remove the three electric invaders.
  - When you see the message that you can launch the boat, board the boat.  - 
  - All missions must be completed within 600 seconds of the start of the game.
  - Fire and Invader contact drops health and gains Hearts 10 health.
  - When you fall into deep water, health becomes zero and the game ends.

You will also:
  - visit the wooden bridge, the switch is newly turned on, then the electric invader reappears so you can try the hunt for the invader multiple times.
